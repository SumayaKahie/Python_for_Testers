# Python_for_Testers

## Lesson 4: Variables
ðŸ“˜ Lesson Summary
In Python, variables are labels for data â€” whether it's numbers (integers) or text (strings). Good code starts with clear labels, tested outputs, and an understanding of how each piece fits together.

### ðŸ§ª Python Variable Testing â€“ Code Sample
python
Copy
Edit
x = 10
Institute = "Testing Funda"

print(x)
print(Institute)

print("Testing Funda 1")

### ðŸ’¡ Purpose of the Code
This simple Python script demonstrates the use of variables, data types, and basic output testing. It serves as a foundational example for understanding how Python handles and prints different types of data â€” integers and strings.

### ðŸ“¦ Key Concepts Demonstrated
Variable Declaration:

x = 10 assigns an integer value.

Institute = "Testing Funda" assigns a string value.
This illustrates Pythonâ€™s dynamic typing â€” no need to explicitly declare data types.

### Printing for Output Verification:

Using print() to confirm the values held in variables.

Also prints a static string to show direct output vs variable-based output.

### Readability & Naming:

Variables are named clearly, making the code easy to understand and maintain â€” a good practice for collaborative environments.
